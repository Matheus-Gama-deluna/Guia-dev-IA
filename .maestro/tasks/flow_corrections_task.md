# Task: Corrections to Project Flows and Specialist Names

## Status
- [x] Analyze "Specialist not found" error for Domain Modeling
- [x] Analyze incorrect phase transition (API Contract -> Final Dev)
- [x] Rename "Especialista em Gestão de Produto .md" to remove trailing space
- [x] Update `types.ts` to use correct specialist name for Domain Modeling
- [x] Refactor `FLUXO_MEDIO` in `types.ts` to split Development into Frontend, Backend, Integration (13 phases)
- [x] Refactor `FLUXO_COMPLEXO` in `types.ts` to split Development into Frontend, Backend, Integration (17 phases)
- [x] Verify file existence and type definitions

## Context
User reported errors where the Domain Modeling specialist wasn't found and the flow was skipping directly from API Contract to a generic Development phase instead of following the requested split structure (Frontend -> Backend). Also identified a file naming issue with Product Management specialist.

## Next Steps
- Validate the fixes by reloading the project or checking status.
